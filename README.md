## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Takeoff & Maintain Altitude**:
    - Drone tries to maintain a 2-meter altitude.
    - If it drops below/above ¬±20cm, motor speeds are adjusted.

2. **Obstacle Detection**:
    - Front ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles within 1 meter.
    - If detected, drone hovers to avoid collision.

3. **Camera Stabilization**:
    - Servo ensures a steady camera angle while flying.

- Crop health analysis via NDVI imaging.
- Soil moisture and environmental sensing.
